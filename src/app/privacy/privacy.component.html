  <h2>3. What Legal Bases Do We Rely On To Process Your Information?</h2>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <em>
      <strong>In Short:</strong>
      We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.
    </em>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <strong><u><em>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</em></u></strong>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Consent.</strong>We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.

      <li>
        <strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong>
        We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong>
        We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services

            Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal Obligations.</strong>
        We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vital Interests.</strong>
        We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <strong><u><em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</em></u></strong>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:

    <ul>
      <li>
        If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
      </li>
      <li>
        For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
      </li>
      <li>
        For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
      </li>
      <li>
        If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
      </li>
      <li>
        For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
      </li>
      <li>
        If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
      </li>
      <li>
        If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
      </li>
      <li>
        If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
      </li>
      <li>
        If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
      </li>
      <li>
        If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
      </li>
      <li>
        If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations
      </li>

  <div class="paragraph">
    Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins).

  <div class="paragraph">
    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than three (3) months past the termination of the user's account.
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

    <em>
      <strong>In Short:</strong>
      We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.
    </em>
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.

  <h2>11. Controls For Do-Not-Track Features</h2>

  <div class="paragraph">
    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
