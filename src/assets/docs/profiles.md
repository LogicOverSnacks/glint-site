# Profiles
Glint can manage multiple profiles. These profiles specify which username & email to use when making commits. By default there is a single profile called "Git Config" which cannot be deleted, and when this profile is selected, the username and email will be taken from your <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config" target="_blank">.gitconfig</a> file.

## Add A New Profile
Go to the Settings Page by clicking on the ![Settings](/assets/docs/settings-button.png) button in the top-right of the app, then select the "Profiles" tab. From here you can add, delete, and modify your profiles.
