# Credentials
Glint can manage multiple credentials to authenticate with Git remotes. These credentials allow you to perform actions such as Push, as well as Fetch and Clone for private repositories.

## Add A New Credential
Go to the Settings Page by clicking on the ![Settings](/assets/docs/settings-button.png) button in the top-right of the app, then select the "Credentials" tab. From here you can add, delete, and modify your credentials.

## Configure Credentials Used Per Repository
Each repository can be configured to use a specific credential, for each profile and each remote. You can access these settings by clicking on the ![Repository Settings](/assets/docs/repository-settings-button.png) button in the [Action Bar](/docs/user_interface#2._Action_Bar).


## Configure Credential Access Per Profile
Each profile can be configured to only allow access to certain credentials. You can change these settings when editing a profile on the [Profile Settings page](/docs/profiles).
