# Diff View
The view will be shown whenever a file has been selected in the right-hand side of the app. It shows what changes have been made to the file with full syntax highlighting. Deleted lines are highlighted in red, and added lines in green.

## Layouts
You can toggle the Diff View between 3 layouts by clicking the buttons in the top right:
* Hunk : displays only the lines of the file that have changes.
* Inline : displays the entire file.
* Split : displays the old and new files side-by-side

## Staging / Unstaging / Discarding Changes
When viewing the diff for uncommitted changes, you can stage, unstage, or discard individual lines by selecting them first then clicking the buttons that appear in the top right.
